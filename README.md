# Moodstronaut


Our idea is to create a collaborative emotional star map that reflects the mental well-being of people around the world in real-time. Users log their feelings daily, and their emotions are transformed into digital constellations projected on real-time sky maps. These emotional constellations are then influenced by environmental data—air quality, noise, light pollution—captured by Earth observation satellites.

This project uses space to visualize solidarity, while raising awareness of how our environments silently shape our mental health.
